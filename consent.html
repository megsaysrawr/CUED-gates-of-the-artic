                <h4>Purpose</h4>
                <p>We are students at Olin College of Engineering taking a human­centered design class with the focus on developing software user interfaces.</p>

                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>As a team, we are interested in learning the current pain points for a non­verbal communication platform hopes of improvement. Therefore, we are looking to talk to real users who have experience with these types of interfaces.</p>

                <h4>Information collection techniques that will be used</h4>
                <p>Methods of collecting information may include a combination of the following: observation, interviews, surveys, and conversations.</p>

                <h4>Risks and benefits, especially regarding confidentiality</h4>
                <p>We will maintain confidentiality. We will use pseudonyms in all content generated and won’t share your contact information. We will respect your time.</p>

                <h4>Compensation</h4>
                <p>Compensation will not be provided for participating in this user study. However, some potential benefits to the participant include personal reflection and sharing of your experiences and being a part of the design process.</p>

                <h4>Time commitment</h4>
                <p>This course will take place over one semester. However, we will only be interacting with you for approximately two weeks. We expect the time commitment to be roughly an hour each meeting.</p>
