          <h1>Formal usability study</h1>

          <h4>Question:</h4>
          <p>What manner of “opening” screen makes secondary users most willing to engage in nonverbal chats through our medium?</p>

          <h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
          <p>We are currently assuming that people are most comfortable beginning a nonverbal conversation when introduced to the context with a conversational message. Examples of conversational messages are “Let’s chat nonverbally!”, “I’m in!”, and “No thanks”. We would like to see whether this is, in fact, the case--or, whether a “clinical” or “informative” approach might be better-received by the secondary users (see below).</p>

          <h4>Variables:</h4>
          <p>We are looking to prototype three different types of text on the opening screen:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Conversational</li>
              <li>Clinical (objective/non-personal background on nonverbal communication)</li>
              <li>Informational (personal - why I, specifically, am not talking.)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Constants:</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <ol>Rest of the application</ol>
              <ol>Phone handoff</ol>
              <ol>Interaction flow - from landing page to “yes” / “no,” the same information and options will be presented; we’re just looking at how these choices are “framed.”</ol>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>Response variables:</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>How comfortable the secondary user feels in responding; how likely they would be to respond. This will be asked individually, on a 1-5 scale immediately after using it, and as a relative ranking after all three have been tried.</li>
              <li>Whether the secondary user physically responds as we want - taking the phone and tapping/writing out their responses, or just nods, or taps the button in the primary user’s hand.</li>
              <li>The amount of time it takes for the secondary user to give a response.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Truth-testing:</h4>
          <p>If our hypothesis is correct, we would expect to see that the secondary user would respond in a shorter period of time with greater comfort to a conversational style home screen. If a different option is better, we would expect the same flags to point towards a clinical or informative approach instead.</p>

          <h4>Ideal experimental method:</h4>
          <p>We would like to test a single option with a large number of random people - for example, initiate contact “in the wild” with a random selection of people on a subway, sidewalk, etc.; if we show 40 people just a conversational opening and see if they continue, and show 40 people clinical and 40 people informational, we could get a general idea of which framing is better-received by the population at large.</p>
          <p>Due to resource and time constraints, we will instead test all three interface options (in a random order) with each individual subject; this will mean that by the second and third trials the subject is more familiar with the process, and is thus less accurate. However, we will record that that we show these to each subject in order to compare the response variables for each try and account for the subjects’ learning.</p>
