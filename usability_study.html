          <h1>Formal usability study</h1>

          <h2>Usability study plan</h2>

          <h4>Question:</h4>
          <p>What manner of “opening” screen makes secondary users most willing to engage in nonverbal chats through our medium?</p>

          <h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
          <p>We are currently assuming that people are most comfortable beginning a nonverbal conversation when introduced to the context with a conversational message. Examples of conversational messages are “Let’s chat nonverbally!”, “I’m in!”, and “No thanks”. We would like to see whether this is, in fact, the case--or, whether a “clinical” or “informative” approach might be better-received by the secondary users (see below).</p>

          <h4>Variables:</h4>
          <p>We are looking to prototype three different types of text on the opening screen:</p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Conversational</li>
              <li>Clinical (objective/non-personal background on nonverbal communication)</li>
              <li>Informational (personal - why I, specifically, am not talking.)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Constants:</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <ol>Rest of the application</ol>
              <ol>Phone handoff</ol>
              <ol>Interaction flow - from landing page to “yes” / “no,” the same information and options will be presented; we’re just looking at how these choices are “framed.”</ol>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h4>Response variables:</h4>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>How comfortable the secondary user feels in responding; how likely they would be to respond. This will be asked individually, on a 1-5 scale immediately after using it, and as a relative ranking after all three have been tried.</li>
              <li>Whether the secondary user physically responds as we want - taking the phone and tapping/writing out their responses, or just nods, or taps the button in the primary user’s hand.</li>
              <li>The amount of time it takes for the secondary user to give a response.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Truth-testing:</h4>
          <p>If our hypothesis is correct, we would expect to see that the secondary user would respond in a shorter period of time with greater comfort to a conversational style home screen. If a different option is better, we would expect the same flags to point towards a clinical or informative approach instead.</p>

          <h4>Ideal experimental method:</h4>
          <p>We would like to test a single option with a large number of random people - for example, initiate contact “in the wild” with a random selection of people on a subway, sidewalk, etc.; if we show 40 people just a conversational opening and see if they continue, and show 40 people clinical and 40 people informational, we could get a general idea of which framing is better-received by the population at large.</p>
          <p>Due to resource and time constraints, we will instead test all three interface options (in a random order) with each individual subject; this will mean that by the second and third trials the subject is more familiar with the process, and is thus less accurate. However, we will record that that we show these to each subject in order to compare the response variables for each try and account for the subjects’ learning.</p>

          <h2>Usability Study Results</h2>

          <h4><b>A general overview of what you observed from both informal and formal usability testing in this round.</b></h4>

          <p>When testing the type of message that users see upon opening of the app, we noticed that there wasn’t a total consensus of which screen was the best. Different elements of each appealed to different people. For example, users preferred when the text was specific enough that they knew the situation was, but some text was too specific and colored the conversation. An example of that is our current informational screen saying “I might be having an anxiety attack” lead users to feel like this might be an emergency and they couldn’t say no to the conversation. However, one of our users noted that they said “I’m in” when presented with the conversational screen because they felt curious about what the conversation would be about.</h4>

          <p>Some specifics that we learned about different opening screen types:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Informative led to a counterproductive tone; clinical and conversational were both preferred similarly frequently.<p>
              <ul><li><p>But, the information in clinical/informative was seen as desirable by several users, as “conversational” doesn’t (yet) provide much of a “why.”</p></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Users felt uneasy about the conversational tone because it didn’t explain the current situation</p>
              <ul><li><p>However, at least one user was curious about what the conversation would be about, which is similar to what happens with verbal conversations.</p></li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Too much text will turn away certain users. Our informational screen had a large amount of text, and users didn’t want to read all of that text just to start a conversation.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>A specific report of the response variables on your formal usability pilot, i.e., the thing you said you would be measuring.</h4>

          <p>Our variables include the time it took users to take the phone, what their action was, and then we asked them how comfortable they were beginning the conversation. A link to our results can be found here.</p>

          <p>Many of the variables that we tried to measure were more difficult to measure than we thought that they would be. For example, timing how long it takes users to do various things is difficult when you are the one interacting with them. Also, we were trying to record button flow as the user went through the app, so it is difficult to keep track of both things at the same time. From the tests we did, there was no discernable time difference in interactions with the different versions we presented.</p>

          <p>Another complication of our variables is that we were trying to measure how users react to the app when seeing it for the first time. But because we wanted to test multiple opening screens, that mean that we were testing the same opening with the same user multiple times. Thus, the results for the second trial are influenced by the fact that the users have already experienced the app and are familiar with what we are trying to do. We attempted to mitigate this issue by testing different orderings of opening screens. That way, we could compare all of the users who had one type of screen initially with users who had a different type of screen the second time.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, since we were doing user testing with fellow students, they may have been more comfortable taking the phone because they are accustomed to people showing them things they’ve made on their phone. While we got valuable information from them about the comfort or discomfort of handing off and receiving phones, we would need to test our interface with people who didn’t know about the project or class to get a better sense of that.</p>

          <h4>An interpretation of those response variables: if those results held with a larger user population, what would it mean for your system?</h4>

          <p>In addition to learning specifically about what we were studying, we learned more about other aspects of the initial interaction. Based on the data, it looks like about half of our users tapped buttons on the phone rather than taking it. This indicates that there might be a larger usability problem: as a person who is nonverbal, how can you communicate to the other person that they are supposed to take the phone from your hands? If half of the time that you interact with other users, they don’t respond in the way that you want them to, that needs to be fixed.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, our theory was that users would prefer the conversational intro because there is less startup time, and it feels for playful, so we thought that users would be more comfortable and relaxed entering that conversation. Instead, it seems that some users felt confused by the lack of information and uneasy at not knowing what was happening.</p>

          <h4>An explanation of what you intend to do in the next week (or what else you would do if you had more time) in response to what you've seen so far. This is the most important part of the write-up, since you need to think about how you would fix your system as a result of what you observed.</h4>

          <p>Our experiment was pretty straight-forward in that the data shows us which of the three were preferred by the user. The results of our experiment are interesting, because we aren’t going to choose any of the three options directly. We are going to think about the elements of each of the things we tested that people preferred, and think about how to create opening text that incorporates those elements. However, it seems that there weren’t any unique aspects of the informational text that people preferred. People didn’t like how much specific medical information the informational gave, and the text was too long as an introduction to a casual conversation.</p>

          <p>Aspects of various screens that users liked or preferred: information about what the app was, a lack of information that colored the tone of the conversation immediately, and a medium length of text that isn’t too tedious to read.</p>

          <p>There were, though, several significant issues with our study methodology--ones which we would ideally address, given greater time and resources, but which certainly colored our present results. For example: when trying to gauge how someone would react “in the wild” - their organic responses to an interface - we should ideally not know the user and bring up the subject of usability testing. Unfortunately, we knew pretty much the entire sample population; as such, there was a baseline level of comfort/familiarity which would not be found by our actual primary users.</p>

          <p>Additionally, the level of willingness to converse with someone, using their phone, was undoubtedly inflated: in our tests, users were hesitant to take someone else’s phone, but were much more willing to take a “leap” due to their previous interactions with us (courses, conversations, etc.).</p>
